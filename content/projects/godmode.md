# godmode

Self-contained Rust-native development methodology plugin for Claude Code.

> Inspired by and built on the ideas in [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by [obra](https://github.com/obra) — the original agentic skills framework for Claude Code. Godmode replaces the superpowers runtime with a Rust-backed CLI and task graph, but the methodology, skill structure, and session ritual are directly descended from that work.

## Overview

Godmode combines a Claude Code skill set with a CLI-backed task graph. The binary owns all
stateful operations — skills are thin wrappers that call `godmode` and act on the output.
Tasks persist in `.ctx/godmode/tasks.yaml` (gitignored) across sessions via causal
`depends_on` chains.

## Install

```bash
cargo build --release -p godmode-cli && cp target/release/godmode ~/.cargo/bin/godmode
claude plugin install godmode@bazaar
```

### Pre-commit hook

Install the godmode pre-commit hook into any git repo to block commits when tasks are
still running and to run cargo gates (fmt-check, clippy, nextest):

```bash
# From the repo root where you want the hook installed:
nu /path/to/godmode/hooks/install.nu

# Or, if godmode is installed as a plugin and $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is set:
nu "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/install.nu"
```

The hook:

1. Runs `godmode handoff --json` — exits non-zero if any task is in `running` state,
   printing the offending task IDs.
2. Runs `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, and
   `cargo nextest run --workspace`.
3. Blocks the commit on any failure with a clear message.

If `godmode` is not on PATH, the task-state check is skipped gracefully and only the
cargo gates run.

## CLI Reference

### Session

```bash
godmode handon      # triage at session start — prints running, next, blocked
godmode handoff     # validate at session end — warns on tasks left running
```

### Task graph

```bash
godmode task list
godmode task add <title> [--id <id>] [--depends-on t1,t2] [--crate-name <crate>]
godmode task start <id>
godmode task done <id> [--commit <sha>] [--notes <text>]
godmode task block <id> <reason>
godmode task unblock <id>
godmode task remove <id>
godmode task clear --done           # prune completed tasks
godmode task clear --all            # reset graph entirely
godmode task next                   # show next runnable task(s)
godmode task run <id> [--auto-done] # run task's run: command; --auto-done marks done on exit 0
godmode task pull [--project <name>] # import pending doob todos as tasks
godmode task push-done               # mark completed tasks done in doob
```

### Status

```bash
godmode status                      # counts + next runnable, no external calls
```

### Plan ingestion

```bash
godmode plan ingest docs/plans/2026-05-01-my-feature.md
```

Parses `### Task N: <title>` headings, optional **Crate**: `name` and **Run**: `cmd` annotations. Builds sequential deps automatically. Idempotent —
re-running a plan skips existing task IDs silently.

### Parallel dispatch

```bash
godmode dispatch [--max 5]
```

Emits a JSON array of independent task chains for parallel agent dispatch. Each chain
targets one crate. Cap defaults to 5 (API rate limit). Feed this output to
`godmode:parallel-agents`.

Example output:

```json
[
  { "crate_name": "godmode-core", "tasks": ["t1", "t2"] },
  { "crate_name": "godmode-cli", "tasks": ["t3"] }
]
```

## Task File

`.ctx/godmode/tasks.yaml` — ephemeral, gitignored. Schema:

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: t1
    title: "Write failing test for FooAdapter"
    status: done # pending | running | done | blocked
    depends_on: []
    crate_name: foo-core
    commit: abc1234
    notes: "test confirmed failing then green"
    completed: 2026-05-01

  - id: t2
    title: "Implement FooAdapter"
    status: pending
    depends_on: [t1]
    crate_name: foo-core
    notes: ""
```

## Workflow

```
brainstorm → writing-plans → plan ingest → handon
  → task next → task start → [tdd] → task done → task next → ...
  → dispatch (parallel chains) → parallel-agents
  → verification-before-completion → handoff
```

## Commands

Slash commands live in `commands/gm/` and map to skills or multi-skill workflows. Invoked
from the Claude Code command palette (e.g. `/gm:cap`, `/gm:tdd`, `/gm:feature`).

**Atomic** (single skill): `cap`, `tdd`, `debug`, `refactor`, `review-code`, `ci-fix`,
`self-heal`, `plan`, `tackle-issues`, `moa-review`, `preflight`, `handon`, `handoff`,
`fresh-branch`, `introspect`, `dispatch-all`, `auth-fail-fast`, `test-fix-commit`, `trace`

**Workflow** (multi-skill pipelines):

| Command           | Pipeline                                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`      | brainstorm → design                                                         |
| `ideate`          | repo scan → gap analysis → brainstorm                                       |
| `feature`         | brainstorm → design → writing-plans → tdd → verify → cap                    |
| `ship`            | verification → changelog → release-notes → cap                              |
| `release`         | readiness-check → impact → bump → changelog → release-notes → cap           |
| `audit`           | health-score → dead-code → dep-audit → mistake-tracker → repo-gap-backlog   |
| `pr`              | code-review → doublecheck → pr-author → merge                               |
| `review-incoming` | receiving-review → verify → cap                                             |
| `deps`            | dep-audit → dep-bump → cap                                                  |
| `session-end`     | whatidid → self-reflect → mistake-tracker → memory-banking → session-wrap   |
| `improve-agent`   | self-reflect → pattern-learner → agent-improvement-loop → agents-skill-save |
| `context`         | context-map → memory-banking → mini-context-graph                           |

See `commands/gm/README.md` for the full reference.

## Helpers

Helper scripts live in `skills/<skill>/helpers/`. Shared utilities are in `skills/_lib/`:

| Module       | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `helpers.nu` | `repo-root`, `run-checked`, `cargo-gate`, `assert-not-main` |
| `trace.nu`   | Structured JSONL trace events (skill.start/complete/error)  |

The `task-driven-development` skill ships a standalone `rust-script` helper:

| Script                                                  | Purpose                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skills/task-driven-development/helpers/task-runner.rs` | Phase runner: init / red / green / refactor / next / status / fail / close-issues |

Trace output lands in `.ctx/godmode/traces/trace.jsonl`. Use `godmode:observability-as-infrastructure`
to query it.

### Session tracing

Two hooks emit session lifecycle events automatically:

- `hooks/scripts/session-start.nu` (SessionStart) — writes `session.start` to the trace
- `hooks/scripts/stop-guard.nu` (Stop) — writes `session.end` on clean exit

Both delegate to `hooks/scripts/godmode-trace.rs` (a `rust-script` binary) which owns all
trace I/O. A fresh `session_id` (`<git-sha>-<epoch-ms>`) is generated each session and
persisted to `.ctx/godmode/session.json`. The session file is read by `session.end` to
correlate the pair. Both hooks degrade silently if not in a git repo or if `rust-script`
is unavailable.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
