AI-powered dev workflow toolkit. Extracts a self-correcting CI/agent loop into a reusable scaffold for any project.

## What it does

- **council** — runs parallel AI roles (strict critic, creative explorer, analyst, security reviewer, performance analyst) against your branch diff and synthesizes a weighted health score. Strict critic and analyst use Anthropic; creative explorer and performance analyst use OpenAI when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
- **review** — single-pass AI diff review focused on a configurable concern area
- **diagnose** — runs an LLM agent against local logs and system state to report root cause, evidence, fix, and confidence level
- **meta** — designs and runs parallel agents for any freeform task against your repo context
- **ci-agent** — standalone binary that diagnoses failed CI jobs and opens/updates issues automatically (GitHub and Gitea)

## Requirements

- Go 1.23+
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (all commands)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional — used for two council roles and ci-agent fallback)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional — ci-agent fallback only)
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for the interactive installer
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) and [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) — used by agent tools (GlobTool and GrepTool)

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89jobrien/devkit/v0.0.1/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone and run locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/89jobrien/devkit
cd devkit
bash install.sh
```

The installer will:

1. Ask which components and CI platform(s) to enable
2. Install the `devkit` and `ci-agent` binaries via `go install`
3. Write `.devkit.toml` in your project root
4. Copy the appropriate CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or `.gitea/workflows/ci.yml`)
5. Install git hooks — `pre-push` runs `devkit council --base main` (non-blocking); `post-commit` prints a council reminder
6. Write Claude Code hooks to `.claude/settings.json` so `devkit review` runs after file edits

Bypass git hooks any time with `DEVKIT_SKIP_HOOKS=1 git push`.

## Usage

```sh
# AI diff review
devkit review --base main

# Multi-role branch analysis (also runs as a pre-push hook and on PRs)
devkit council --base main --mode core
devkit council --base main --mode extensive   # adds security + performance roles

# Diagnose a local service failure from logs and system state
devkit diagnose
devkit diagnose --service postgres
devkit diagnose --log-cmd "tail -n 500 /var/log/myapp.log"

# Run parallel agents on any freeform task
devkit meta "find all places where we do not validate user input"
echo "audit the auth layer" | devkit meta
```

All commands log to `~/.dev-agents/<project>/`.

          bump-version job (ci/github.yml)
          ────────────────────────────────
          reads VERSION, bumps minor (0.N.0)
          commits + pushes [bump version]
```

One job in `.github/workflows/devkit.yml`:

- **council** — fires on every PR; runs multi-agent council review and posts findings as a PR comment (updates on re-push)

Required secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## CI integration

The CI templates in `ci/` include:

- A `diagnose` job that runs `ci-agent` automatically on any CI failure, opening a GitHub/Gitea issue with an AI diagnosis
- A `bump-version` job (GitHub only) that increments the minor version (`0.N.0`) on every successful push to main

## Configuration

`.devkit.toml` (generated by `install.sh`):

```toml
[project]
name        = "my-project"
description = "What it does"
install_date = "2026-01-01"
ci_platforms = ["github"]

[components]
council  = true
review   = true
meta     = true
ci_agent = true
diagnose = true

[review]
focus = "security, performance, correctness"

[council]
mode = "core"

[diagnose]
# log_cmd = "journalctl -n 200 --no-pager"   # uncomment and customize if needed
# service = ""                                 # focus on a specific service
```

## Upgrading

```sh
bash upgrade.sh
```

## Architecture

Hexagonal Go: each internal package (`council`, `review`, `diagnose`, `meta`, `loop`, `tools`, `platform`, `log`) defines a `Runner` or `Platform` interface. Concrete implementations are wired at the `cmd/` layer. No package imports another's concrete type.
