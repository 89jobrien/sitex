This repo is superseded by [`~/.notfiles`](https://github.com/89jobrien/notfiles), managed with
the `notfiles` symlink-based dotfiles manager. Active tooling (mise tasks, scripts, secrets,
Brewfiles, etc.) now lives at `~/.dotfiles-tools`, linked in from `~/.notfiles/dotfiles-tools`.

This repo is kept around read-only for history. Do not add new packages or config here — add
them to `~/.notfiles` instead.

One item is still mid-migration as of this archival: the `colima` package (Docker/Lima autostart
config) has not yet been ported.
